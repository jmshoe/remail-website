# Design Iteration

Generate design variations for a component or section.

## Arguments
- `$ARGUMENTS`: Component or section name (e.g., "hero", "pricing-card", "navbar", "testimonials")

## Step 1: Read Design Brief

@docs/DESIGN-BRIEF.md

## Step 2: Understand Current State

If there's an existing implementation, read it first.

Identify what aspects could be varied:
- Layout arrangement
- Color application
- Typography treatment
- Visual elements (icons, images, patterns)
- Interaction styles

## Step 3: Generate 3 Variations

### Variation A: [Name/Theme]
- **Approach**: Description of approach
- **Key differentiator**: What makes this unique
- **Code**: Implementation

### Variation B: [Name/Theme]
- **Approach**: Description of approach
- **Key differentiator**: What makes this unique
- **Code**: Implementation

### Variation C: [Name/Theme]
- **Approach**: Description of approach
- **Key differentiator**: What makes this unique
- **Code**: Implementation

## Step 4: Ask for Selection

"Which variation do you prefer? Or would you like to mix elements from different options?"

## Guidelines

- All variations must follow the design brief
- Each should have a distinct personality while staying on-brand
- Consider contrasts:
  - Minimal vs. bold
  - Centered vs. asymmetric
  - Image-heavy vs. text-focused
  - Light vs. dark sections
