If you've spent any time in real estate investing, you've probably used PropStream. It's one of the most popular property data platforms out there, and for good reason—it has solid data, decent filtering, and a recognizable name.

But here's what most investors don't realize: PropStream has a fundamental limitation that's costing them hours every single week. And if you're trying to scale beyond manual processes, that limitation becomes a serious problem.

I'm talking about automation. Or more specifically, PropStream's complete lack of it.

In this guide, I'm going to break down the real differences between PropStream and PropertyRadar—two platforms that look similar on the surface but are fundamentally different when it comes to what you can actually *do* with your data.

## Quick Comparison: PropStream vs PropertyRadar at a Glance

Before we dive deep, here's the high-level overview:

| Feature | PropStream | PropertyRadar |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| Property Database | 160+ million | 150+ million |
| Search Filters | 160+ | 250+ |
| Pre-built Lead Lists | 20 | 120+ |
| Public API | ❌ None | ✅ Full REST API |
| Webhooks | ❌ None | ✅ Full support |
| Zapier Integration | ❌ None | ✅ 8,000+ apps |
| Skip Tracing Cost | $0.12/record | $0.08/record |
| Base Price | $99/mo | $119/mo |

The data quality? Comparable. The pricing? Similar. The automation capabilities? Not even close.

## What is PropStream?

PropStream is a property data platform that's been around since 2017. It was acquired by Stewart Title for $175 million in 2021, and more recently acquired BatchLeads and BatchDialer in 2025 to expand its ecosystem.

At its core, PropStream provides:
- Nationwide property data with owner information
- Skip tracing services
- Marketing tools (postcards, letters, email)
- Comps and ARV calculations
- Basic list building and filtering

For a lot of investors, PropStream is their first introduction to property data platforms. And honestly, it does the basics well. You can pull lists of absentee owners, filter by equity, and export to CSV for your campaigns.

**Who PropStream is best for:**
- Investors who prefer an all-in-one platform
- Those who don't need workflow automation
- Users who want MLS data integration
- Beginners who want guided lead lists

## What is PropertyRadar?

PropertyRadar has been around since 2007—a decade longer than PropStream. It's built on a fundamentally different philosophy: your property data should integrate with the rest of your business, not sit in a silo.

PropertyRadar provides:
- Comprehensive property and owner data
- Advanced filtering with 250+ criteria
- Full API access (Business plan)
- Webhook triggers for real-time automation
- Native Zapier integration with 8,000+ apps
- Built-in list monitoring and alerts

The key difference? PropertyRadar treats your data as the starting point, not the end point. Everything is designed to flow into your CRM, your dialer, your direct mail platform—wherever it needs to go.

**Who PropertyRadar is best for:**
- Investors scaling beyond manual processes
- Teams needing CRM integration
- Anyone building automated marketing workflows
- Developers wanting API access
- Users who value granular filtering

## Data Quality Comparison

Let's start with what most people compare first: the actual property data.

### Database Coverage

| Metric | PropStream | PropertyRadar |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Properties | 160+ million | 150+ million |
| Coverage | Nationwide | Nationwide |
| Update Frequency | Regular | Regular |
| MLS Data | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |

Both platforms have solid nationwide coverage. PropStream edges out slightly in raw property count, but 150 million vs 160 million isn't going to meaningfully impact your list building.

### Filtering Capabilities

This is where things start to diverge.

**PropStream** offers 160+ search filters across:
- Property characteristics
- Owner information
- Financial data (equity, liens, mortgage)
- Distress indicators

**PropertyRadar** offers 250+ search criteria including everything PropStream has, plus:
- Demographic data (age, income, family composition)
- Behavioral indicators
- More granular geographic targeting
- Custom scoring and ranking

The extra 90+ filters might not seem like a big deal until you're trying to build highly targeted lists. Being able to filter by owner age range, estimated income, or presence of children can dramatically improve response rates for certain campaigns.

### Pre-built Lists

**PropStream** includes 20 pre-built "Quick Lists" for common investor criteria.

**PropertyRadar** includes 120+ "Quick Lists" covering a much wider range of scenarios.

More pre-built lists means faster list building when you're testing new strategies or entering new markets.

### Verdict on Data Quality

The data itself is comparable. Both platforms aggregate from similar sources and provide reliable property information. PropertyRadar has an edge in filtering granularity and pre-built lists, but it's not a dealbreaker either way.

Where things get interesting is what happens after you build your list.

## Pricing Breakdown

Let's talk money. Both platforms have tiered pricing, but the structure is different.

### PropStream Pricing

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | Exports | Users | Skip Tracing |
|------|---------|--------|---------|-------|--------------|
| Essentials | $99/mo | $81/mo | 25,000 | 1 | $0.12/record |
| Pro | $199/mo | $165/mo | 50,000 | 2 | Included |
| Elite | $699/mo | $583/mo | 100,000 | 9 | Included |

**Hidden costs to know about:**
- List Automator add-on: $27/month (if you want your lists to auto-update)
- Skip tracing on Essentials: $0.12 per record
- Additional users on Pro: $30/month each
- No rollover on unused exports

### PropertyRadar Pricing

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | Exports | Users | Skip Tracing |
|------|---------|--------|---------|-------|--------------|
| Solo | $119/mo | $99/mo | 10,000 | 1 | 250 free, then $0.08 |
| Team | $249/mo | $199/mo | 25,000 | 3 | 500 free |
| Business | $599/mo | $549/mo | 50,000 | 10 | 2,500 free |

**What's included:**
- Skip tracing credits at every tier
- List monitoring and alerts at all tiers
- API access on Business plan
- Zapier integration on all plans

### Cost Comparison

At first glance, PropertyRadar looks slightly more expensive—$119/mo vs $99/mo at the entry level. But when you factor in what's included:

- PropertyRadar includes skip tracing credits; PropStream charges extra on Essentials
- PropertyRadar includes list auto-updates; PropStream charges $27/mo extra
- PropertyRadar skip tracing is $0.08/record vs $0.12/record

For investors doing any real volume, PropertyRadar often ends up costing the same or less.

**Skip tracing cost difference at scale:**

| Volume | PropStream Cost | PropertyRadar Cost |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1,000 records | $120 | $80 |
| 5,000 records | $600 | $400 |
| 10,000 records | $1,200 | $800 |

At 10,000 records per month, you're saving $400 just on skip tracing. That adds up fast.

## The Automation Gap: Why This Matters More Than Price

Here's where we get to the real difference between these platforms. And honestly, this is the entire reason I'm writing this comparison.

**PropStream has no public API. No webhooks. No Zapier integration.**

Let that sink in. In 2026, one of the most popular property data platforms has essentially zero automation capabilities beyond their own ecosystem.

### PropStream's "Export Hell"

If you're a PropStream user, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Here's what your workflow probably looks like:

1. Build a list in PropStream
2. Export to CSV
3. Clean up the CSV (fix formatting, remove duplicates)
4. Import into your CRM
5. Map the fields (hope nothing breaks)
6. Import into your dialer
7. Map the fields again
8. Import into your direct mail platform
9. More field mapping
10. Repeat steps 2-9 every time you want to update your list

Sound familiar? I've talked to investors who spend 5-10 hours per week just shuffling data between PropStream and their other tools.

And here's the worst part: your lists go stale. By the time you've manually processed everything, new motivated sellers have entered the market and existing ones might have already sold. You're always playing catch-up.

### What PropertyRadar Enables

PropertyRadar takes the opposite approach. Instead of being a data silo, it's designed to be a data hub.

**Webhooks:** When a property matches your criteria—new pre-foreclosure, high-equity absentee owner, whatever—PropertyRadar can instantly send that data to any endpoint. Your CRM. Your dialer. Your direct mail platform. A custom application.

The moment a new lead appears, it's already in your system. No manual exports. No stale data.

**Zapier Integration:** Connect PropertyRadar to 8,000+ apps without writing a single line of code. Real examples:

- New pre-foreclosure → Add to HubSpot → Send personalized email → Create follow-up task
- High-equity absentee owner → Add to mailing list → Trigger direct mail campaign
- Property changes hands → Alert team in Slack → Update tracking spreadsheet
- Owner enters probate → Add to Podio → Start nurture sequence

**API Access:** For developers or teams with technical resources, PropertyRadar's REST API lets you:
- Pull data programmatically on any schedule
- Enrich your own databases
- Build custom dashboards and reports
- Create integrations specific to your workflow

### The Time Savings Are Real

Let's quantify this:

| Task | PropStream | PropertyRadar |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Export new leads to CRM | 15-30 min manual | Automatic |
| Update mailing lists | 15-30 min manual | Automatic |
| Send to direct mail | 15-30 min manual | Auto-trigger |
| Track property changes | Manual re-search | Real-time alerts |
| Weekly time investment | 5-10 hours | < 1 hour |

At even $50/hour for your time, that's $200-500 per week in time savings. Over a year? $10,000-25,000 worth of recovered time that you can spend on activities that actually generate revenue—like talking to motivated sellers.

## Integration Capabilities Deep Dive

Let's get specific about what integrations actually look like on each platform.

### PropStream Integrations

PropStream's integration story is... limited.

- **BatchDialer:** They acquired this, so it works seamlessly
- **BatchLeads:** Same situation—works because they own it
- **Everything else:** Manual CSV export

That's basically it. Want to connect PropStream to HubSpot? Export to CSV. Salesforce? CSV. Podio? CSV. Your direct mail platform? You guessed it—CSV.

The lack of an API means there's no way to build custom integrations either. You're stuck with what PropStream decides to build in-house.

### PropertyRadar Integrations

PropertyRadar connects directly to:

**CRMs:**
- HubSpot
- Salesforce
- Zoho
- Pipedrive
- Podio
- Follow Up Boss
- And dozens more via Zapier

**Marketing Platforms:**
- Mailchimp
- ActiveCampaign
- Constant Contact
- SendGrid

**Communication Tools:**
- Slack
- Microsoft Teams
- Discord

**Dialers:**
- Mojo Dialer (via Zapier)
- Call Tools
- PhoneBurner

**Project Management:**
- Asana
- Monday.com
- Trello
- Notion

**And for Direct Mail...**

Here's where it gets interesting for our use case. PropertyRadar can automatically trigger direct mail campaigns when leads match your criteria. Set it up once, and new motivated sellers get your marketing piece without you lifting a finger.

That's the workflow we recommend for [automated direct mail campaigns](/services)—let the data platform identify the leads, automatically route them to your mail service, and focus your time on responding to inbound calls.

## Who Should Use PropStream?

Let me be fair—PropStream isn't a bad product. It's actually quite good for certain use cases:

**PropStream is right for you if:**
- You're just getting started and want everything in one place
- Your volume is low enough that manual exports aren't painful
- You prefer simplicity over flexibility
- You primarily need MLS comps and data research
- You're not trying to build automated workflows
- You like the BatchDialer integration

**PropStream's strengths:**
- Clean, intuitive interface
- Solid property data
- Built-in marketing tools
- MLS data integration
- BatchDialer/BatchLeads ecosystem

## Who Should Use PropertyRadar?

**PropertyRadar is right for you if:**
- You're scaling beyond manual processes
- You want your tools to talk to each other
- You need CRM integration that actually works
- You're building automated marketing workflows
- You value granular filtering options
- You want API access for custom solutions
- You're sending volume where skip tracing costs matter

**PropertyRadar's strengths:**
- Automation capabilities (API, webhooks, Zapier)
- More granular filtering (250+ criteria)
- Lower skip tracing costs
- More pre-built lists (120+)
- Real-time alerts and monitoring

## Can You Use Both Together?

Some investors run both platforms. Here's when that might make sense:

**Use PropStream for:**
- MLS data and comps
- Initial property research
- One-off lookups

**Use PropertyRadar for:**
- Automated list building
- Workflow triggers
- CRM integration
- High-volume campaigns

The downside is you're paying for two subscriptions. For most investors, picking one platform—specifically the one that fits your workflow—makes more sense than maintaining both.

If automation matters to you at all, that platform should be PropertyRadar.

## The Verdict: PropertyRadar Wins for Scalability

Let me be direct: if you're trying to build a real estate investing business that scales, PropertyRadar is the clear choice.

The data quality is comparable. The pricing is similar. But the automation capabilities aren't even in the same league.

PropStream keeps you stuck in manual "export hell" where you're spending hours every week on data entry that should be automatic. PropertyRadar lets you build systems that run themselves.

For investors sending [thousands of mailers monthly](/services) or managing active outreach campaigns, that difference is everything. The time you save goes directly into your bottom line.

**The bottom line:**
- Similar data ✓
- Similar price ✓
- PropertyRadar automation capabilities > PropStream by a mile

## How to Get Started with PropertyRadar

If you're ready to make the switch, here's my recommended path:

**1. Start with the Solo plan ($119/mo)**

Get familiar with the interface and build a few test lists. The 10,000 export limit is plenty while you're learning.

**2. Set up your first Zapier automation**

Connect PropertyRadar to your CRM. Even this simple automation will save you hours per month.

**3. Create a "New Leads" webhook**

Have PropertyRadar automatically notify you (Slack, email, whatever) when new properties match your criteria.

**4. Build your direct mail workflow**

Connect your lists to an automated mail service. When a new motivated seller appears, their first postcard should go out without manual intervention.

**5. Upgrade to Team or Business as you scale**

Once you're comfortable and seeing results, unlock more exports and API access.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is PropStream or PropertyRadar better for wholesaling?

PropertyRadar. Wholesaling is a volume game, and automation is essential for managing high-volume outreach efficiently. The ability to automatically route new leads to your CRM and trigger follow-up sequences gives you a significant advantage over competitors still manually exporting CSVs.

### Does PropStream have an API?

No. PropStream does not offer a public API, webhooks, or any programmatic access to your data. The only way to get data out is through manual CSV exports.

### Can I integrate PropStream with my CRM?

Only through manual CSV exports and imports. There's no direct integration with HubSpot, Salesforce, Podio, or any other CRM.

### How accurate is PropertyRadar data?

PropertyRadar reports similar accuracy to other major property data providers. They use machine learning combined with human back-testing to enhance data quality. G2 rating is 4.7 stars. As with any data platform, you should verify critical information before making investment decisions.

### Is PropertyRadar worth it for beginners?

If you're truly just starting out and doing very low volume, the extra $20/month over PropStream might not matter much. But if you plan to scale—and you should—starting with PropertyRadar means you won't have to migrate later when you outgrow manual processes.

### Can I export PropertyRadar data to direct mail services?

Yes, both automatically and manually. PropertyRadar integrates with direct mail platforms through Zapier, webhooks, or API. You can also export lists as CSV if you prefer manual uploads. For [automated direct mail campaigns](/services), the integration capabilities are a major advantage.

Both platforms offer monthly and annual options. Neither requires long-term contracts, though you get better rates with annual billing.
