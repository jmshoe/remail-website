# REmail Image Strategy & Generation Guide

## Image Style Guidelines

Based on your design brief, images should convey:

### Visual Style
- **Modern SaaS aesthetic** (like Linear, Stripe, Vercel)
- **Clean and professional** - no cluttered or busy compositions
- **Avoid stock photo look** - authentic, modern, intentional
- **Color palette**: Primary #2563EB (trust blue), Accent #10B981 (growth green)
- **Minimalist approach** - whitespace, clean backgrounds
- **Professional but approachable** - not overly corporate
- **Target audience**: Real estate investors (25-55, tech-savvy, ROI-focused)

### What to Avoid
- Generic stock photos (overly posed, fake smiles)
- Purple AI gradients and abstract blobs
- Overly corporate/boring visuals
- Cluttered compositions
- Harsh shadows or high contrast
- Neon/bright colors
- Traditional real estate clichés (handshakes, keys, etc.)

## Implementation Recommendations

### Recommended Approach

1. **Start with AI Generation** (fastest, most control)
   - Use DALL-E 3 or Midjourney with the prompts above
   - Generate 2-3 variations per service
   - Pick the best match for your brand

2. **Stock Photos as Backup** (if AI doesn't work)
   - Search Unsplash/Pexels with the search terms provided
   - Edit in Canva/Figma to add brand color overlays
   - Apply subtle filters to match aesthetic

3. **Custom Graphics** (if budget allows)
   - Commission custom illustrations for unique brand identity
   - Especially good for hero sections or key pages

### Image Specifications

- **Dimensions**: 1920x1080px (can scale down to 1280x720px for web)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (matches your current placeholder)
- **Format**: WebP (modern) or JPG (compatibility)
- **File Size**: Aim for < 200KB per image (optimize with TinyPNG, Squoosh)
- **Color Profile**: sRGB

### Image Optimization

1. **Compress images**:
   - Use TinyPNG (https://tinypng.com)
   - Or Squoosh (https://squoosh.app)
   - Target: < 200KB per image

2. **Create responsive sizes**:
   - Desktop: 1920x1080px
   - Tablet: 1280x720px
   - Mobile: 640x360px
   - Use Next.js Image component with `srcset`

3. **Lazy loading**:
   - Use Next.js Image component (automatic lazy loading)
   - Add `loading="lazy"` attribute

### Adding Images to Your Site

Once you have images:

1. Save to `/public/images/services/`
2. Name files descriptively: `direct-mail-campaigns.jpg`, `skip-tracing.jpg`, etc.
3. Update `src/app/(marketing)/services/page.tsx` to use Next.js Image component

Example code:
```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

// In your service component:
<div className="aspect-video rounded-lg overflow-hidden bg-slate-200">
  <Image
    src="/images/services/direct-mail-campaigns.jpg"
    alt="Direct mail campaigns visualization"
    width={1920}
    height={1080}
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  />
</div>
```
