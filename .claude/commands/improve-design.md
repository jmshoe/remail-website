# Improve Design

Improve the visual design of a component or page.

## Arguments
- $ARGUMENTS: File path (e.g., src/app/page.tsx)

## Step 1: Read the Design Brief
```bash
cat docs/DESIGN-BRIEF.md
```

## Step 2: Read the Current File
Analyze the current implementation and identify:
- Typography issues (hierarchy, sizes, weights)
- Spacing problems (too cramped, inconsistent)
- Color usage (not following brand)
- Missing hover states/interactions
- Shadow/depth issues
- Border radius inconsistencies

## Step 3: Apply Improvements
Fix issues following these priorities:
1. Typography hierarchy (most impactful)
2. Spacing and whitespace
3. Color consistency with brand
4. Shadows and depth
5. Micro-interactions
6. Polish and refinement

## Step 4: Before/After Summary
Explain what was changed and why:
- "Increased heading size for better hierarchy"
- "Added consistent 12px border radius"
- "Changed shadow to softer, more diffused style"
- "Added hover lift effect to cards"

## Output
Edit the file with improvements.
Do NOT change functionality, only visual styling.
