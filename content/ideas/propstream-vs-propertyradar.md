## Executive Summary

This article targets the massive **49,500 monthly search volume** for "PropStream" while positioning PropertyRadar as the superior choice for investors who need **automation, API access, and workflow integration**. The editorial angle highlights that while both platforms offer similar data at comparable prices, PropertyRadar's automation capabilities make it the clear winner for scaling operations.

## Research Summary

### Key Finding: The Automation Gap

| Capability | PropStream | PropertyRadar |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| Public API | ❌ None | ✅ Full REST API (Business plan) |
| Webhooks | ❌ None | ✅ Full webhook support |
| Zapier Integration | ❌ None | ✅ 8,000+ app integrations |
| Automated List Updates | ⚠️ $27/mo add-on | ✅ Included |
| Real-time Alerts | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Instant triggers |
| CRM Integrations | ❌ Manual CSV export only | ✅ HubSpot, Salesforce, Zoho, etc. |

**This is the core differentiator.** PropStream users are stuck in "export hell" — manually exporting CSVs, cleaning data, and importing to other tools. PropertyRadar users can build automated workflows that trigger actions the moment a property matches their criteria.

## Pricing Comparison

### PropStream
| Plan | Monthly | Annual | Saves/Exports | Users | Skip Tracing |

| Elite | $699/mo | $583/mo | 100,000 | 9 | Included |

**Hidden costs:** List Automator ($27/mo), skip tracing on Essentials plan, no rollover on unused exports

### PropertyRadar

| Business | $599/mo | $549/mo | 50,000 | 10 | 2,500 included |

**Key advantages:** Skip tracing included at all tiers, API access on Business plan, integrations included, lower per-record skip tracing cost ($0.08 vs $0.12)

## The Automation Advantage (Editorial Focus)

### What PropStream Users Deal With

> "PropStream users know the manual export struggle all too well, as the platform lacks open API access or Zapier connectivity. Want PropStream leads in your dialer? Export to CSV, clean the data, import to your dialer, map the fields, hope nothing breaks."
> — [REsimpli Review](https://resimpli.com/blog/propstream-review/)

This is the pain point we exploit. PropStream is a **data silo** — great for finding leads, but terrible for doing anything with them automatically.

### What PropertyRadar Enables

1. **Webhook Triggers**: When a property matches your criteria, PropertyRadar can instantly send that data to any endpoint — your CRM, your dialer, your direct mail provider, your custom application.

2. **Zapier Workflows**: Connect to 8,000+ apps. Examples:
   - New pre-foreclosure → Add to HubSpot → Send personalized email → Create follow-up task
   - High-equity absentee owner → Add to mailing list → Trigger direct mail campaign
   - Property changes hands → Alert team in Slack → Update tracking spreadsheet

3. **API Access**: Build custom integrations. Pull data programmatically. Enrich your own databases. Create custom dashboards.

4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Get instant alerts when properties match your criteria. No manual checking required.

### The Business Impact

For investors sending thousands of mailers monthly, the automation difference is massive:

| Task | PropStream | PropertyRadar |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Export new leads to CRM | Manual CSV export, clean, import | Automatic via Zapier/webhook |
| Update mailing lists | Manual refresh + re-export | Automatic list monitoring |
| Send to direct mail | Export, upload to printer | Auto-trigger campaigns |
| Track property changes | Manual re-search | Real-time alerts |
| Time per week | 5-10 hours | < 1 hour |
