# Design Iteration

Generate design variations for a component or section.

## Arguments
- $ARGUMENTS: Component or section (e.g., hero, pricing-card, navbar)

## Step 1: Read Design Brief
```bash
cat docs/DESIGN-BRIEF.md
```

## Step 2: Understand Current State
If there's an existing implementation, read it first.
Identify what aspects could be varied:
- Layout arrangement
- Color application
- Typography treatment
- Visual elements (icons, images, patterns)
- Interaction styles

## Step 3: Generate 3 Variations

### Variation A: [Name/Theme]
- Description of approach
- Key differentiator
- Code implementation

### Variation B: [Name/Theme]
- Description of approach
- Key differentiator
- Code implementation

### Variation C: [Name/Theme]
- Description of approach
- Key differentiator
- Code implementation

## Step 4: Ask for Selection
"Which variation do you prefer? Or would you like to mix elements from different options?"

## Guidelines
- All variations must follow the design brief
- Each should have a distinct personality while staying on-brand
- Consider: minimal vs. bold, centered vs. asymmetric, image-heavy vs. text-focused
