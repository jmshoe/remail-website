# Design Page

Design a new page following the design brief.

## Arguments
- $ARGUMENTS: Page name (e.g., homepage, pricing, features)

## Step 1: Read the Design Brief
First, read the design brief to understand preferences:
```bash
cat docs/DESIGN-BRIEF.md
```

## Step 2: Understand the Page Context
- What is the purpose of this page?
- What are the key sections needed?
- What actions should users take?

## Step 3: Create Layout Structure
Create the page structure with proper sections:
- Navigation header
- Hero section
- Feature/content sections
- Social proof (if applicable)
- CTA section
- Footer

## Step 4: Apply Design Brief Styling
Use the colors, typography, and visual style from the brief:
- Primary color for CTAs
- Proper font sizes and weights
- Consistent spacing (80-120px sections)
- Soft shadows, rounded corners (12px)
- Micro-interactions on hover

## Step 5: Offer Iterations
After initial design, ask:
"Would you like to see 2-3 alternative approaches for any section?"

## Output
Create the page as a React component in the appropriate location.
Use existing UI components from src/components/ui/ when available.
