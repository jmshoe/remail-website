## Content Brief 5: PropStream vs PropertyRadar Comparison

> **Full brief available:** See `propstream-vs-propertyradar.md` for complete research and outline.

**ID / slug idea**: `propstream-vs-propertyradar`

**Primary keyword**: propstream (49,500 monthly, MEDIUM competition)

**Secondary keywords**: propstream alternative (1,900/mo), propstream vs propertyradar (720/mo), propertyradar review (590/mo)

**Headline**: PropStream vs PropertyRadar: The Automation Gap That's Costing You Deals

**Editorial Angle**: PropertyRadar is the superior choice for investors who need automation, API access, and workflow integration. While both platforms offer similar data at comparable prices, PropertyRadar's automation capabilities (webhooks, API, Zapier integration with 8,000+ apps) make it the clear winner for scaling operations. PropStream has NO public API, NO webhooks, and NO Zapier — leaving users stuck in "manual export hell."

**Key Differentiators**:
- PropertyRadar: Full REST API, webhooks, 8,000+ Zapier integrations
- PropStream: No API, no webhooks, no Zapier — manual CSV exports only
- Similar base pricing ($99-$119/mo)
- PropertyRadar includes 250 skip traces/mo; PropStream charges $0.12/record
- Time savings: 5-10 hours/week with PropertyRadar automation

**Search intent**: Commercial (comparison shopping) + Informational

**Word count target**: 3,000-4,000 words
