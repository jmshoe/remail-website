# Design from Reference

Design based on a reference screenshot or URL.

## Arguments
- $ARGUMENTS: URL or path to screenshot in docs/design-references/

## Step 1: Read Design Brief
```bash
cat docs/DESIGN-BRIEF.md
```

## Step 2: Analyze the Reference
If URL provided, fetch and analyze. If screenshot path, read the image.

Identify what makes this design effective:
- Layout structure and composition
- Typography choices
- Color usage and contrast
- Spacing and whitespace
- Visual hierarchy
- Interactive elements
- Unique design elements

## Step 3: Adaptation Plan
Document what to take from the reference and how to adapt for REmail:
- "Taking the split hero layout, adapting colors to our primary blue"
- "Using similar card grid structure, applying our rounded corners"
- "Adopting the headline/subhead size ratio"

## Step 4: Implementation
Create the design, adapting (not copying) from the reference:
- Use REmail brand colors
- Apply our typography system
- Maintain our border radius and shadow styles
- Add our standard interactions

## Step 5: Comparison
Explain how the result relates to the reference:
- What was adapted
- What was changed for brand consistency
- What was improved or simplified

## Note
Never copy designs verbatim. Adapt the principles and patterns to fit REmail's brand.
